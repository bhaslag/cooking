# Drupal Project - cooking

## Info

This project has been initiated with the [architecture skeleton](https://git.smile.fr/drupal/drupal8-architecture-skeleton).

The architecture part has been putted in the [architecture folder](architecture/).

You can use it directly if you want to initiate the lxc, or to make a delivery.

You can find all the __skeleton documentation__ [here](architecture/README.md).

A small personal project created so that I can better understand Drupal 8.
