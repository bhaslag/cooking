Clone your drupal project repository.

Clone your architecture project repository (if it has been separated).
 
 

Step 2
------

Go to your *project folder* and run those commands


```
$ composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

> note:
>   * When installing / updating Drupal modules from your host, you must use composer with --ignore-platform-reqs option

```
$ composer drupal-scaffold
```

Step 3

Go to your *project folder* and run this command

```
$ sudo cdeploy
```
This command will create a new lxc   

Go to your *architecture folder* and run this command

```
$ bash scripts/provision.sh lxc
```
This command will provision the lxc with ansible recipe
